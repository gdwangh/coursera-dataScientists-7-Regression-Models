This is an document to answer 2 questions below using regression models and exploratory data analyses: 
- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

mtcars data set is taken, and the variables is decribed in help:
[, 1]   mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
...
[, 9]   am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
boxplot(mpg~am, data=mtcars)
fit<-lm(mpg~factor(am),data=mtcars)
summary(fit)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
