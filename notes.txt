1. use the residuals (fit$residuals) of our model to estimate the standard deviation (sigma) of the error

sqrt(sum(fit$residuals^2)/(n-2))
= summary(fit)$sigma
= sqrt(deviance(fit)/(n-2))

sum(fit$residuals^2) = deviance(fit)

2. Variation = Residual Variation + Regression Variation
sum of squared term represented Total Variation: Yi-mean(Yi)
sum of squared term represents Residual Variation: Yi-Yi_hat
R^2 = the percent of total variation described by the model, the regression variation

sRes: deviance(fit)  --- Yi-Yi_hat
sTot: sum((galton$child-mean(galton$child))^2) --- Yi-mean(Yi)

the ratio sRes/sTot represents the percent of total variation contributed by the residuals

R^2 = 1 - sRes/sTot
= summary(fit)$r.squared
= cor(galton$child, galton$parent) ^ 2

R^2 is the percentage of variation explained by the regression model. As a percentage it is between 0 and 1. It also equals the sample correlation squared. However, R^2 doesn't tell the whole story.

residuals versus fitted values plot: plot(fit, which=1)
  -- 目的是确认： has none of the patterned appearance of the first. It looks as we would expect if residuals were independently and (almost) identically distributed with zero mean, and were uncorrelated with the fit.
  如果发现有偏离率较高的点，则要将该点从数据集中去掉：The change which inclusion or exclusion of a sample induces in coefficents is a simple measure of its influence. Subtract coef(fitno) from coef(fit) to see the change induced by including the influential first sample.

dfbeta: The function, dfbeta, does the equivalent calculation for every sample in the data. 结果大于一般值的记录，对应图上的偏离点

偏离点y值与排除偏离点以后的回归线预测偏离点y值之间的差距, iss sometimes called influence, sometimes leverage, and sometimes hat value
  out2是包含偏离点的数据，fitno是排除偏离点之后的回归线，1是偏离点：
  resno <- out2[1, "y"] - predict(fitno, out2[1,]) 
 
  1-resid(fit)[1]/resno = hatvalues(fit)[1] --- 是否排除一个点，y值之间的差异大小

hatvalues: The function, hatvalues, performs for every sample a calculation equivalent to the one you've just done. 结果大于一般值的记录，对应图上的偏离点

 standardized residuals：
  the sample standard deviation of fit's residual: deviance(fit)
  the residual degrees of freedom: df.residual(fit)

   sigma <- sqrt(deviance(fit)/df.residual(fit))
   fit's standardized residual: rstd <- resid(fit)/(sigma * sqrt(1-hatvalues(fit)))
   = rstandard(fit) --- 可以用于看偏离率

   plot(fit, which=3) --- A Scale-Location plot shows the square root of standardized residuals against fitted values

  plot(fit, which=2) -- QQ plot of standardized residuals against normal with constant variance

rstudent(fit): The function, rstudent, calculates Studentized residuals for each sample using a procedure equivalent to that which we just used for the outlier
    sigma1<-sqrt(deviance(fitno)/df.residual(fitno))
    resid(fit)[1]/(sigma1 * sqrt(1-hatvalues(fit)[1]))
   是否删除偏离点的差距。差距很大的就是偏离点


Cook's distance: It is essentially the sum of squared differences between values fitted with and without a particular sample. 
   dy<-predict(fitno, out2) - predict(fit, out2)
   sum(dy^2)/(2*sigma^2)
   = cooks.distance(fit)[1]
  
   对应的图：plot(fit, which=5)
